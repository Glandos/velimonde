    <h2>How does it work</h2>
    <p>
    To get started, pick a city at the top, zooming in before that is useless. Then, you can
    access the details of a given station by clicking on it. Do NOT try to zoom into oblivion, that's useless.
    If the city you're looking for is not in the list, well, too bad, it won't show on the map either.
    </p>

    <h2>Looks like it's broken?</h2>
    <p>
    Try flushing your cache (usually Shift-F5, on the <a href="{{ url_for('index')}}">main</a> page).
    If it doesn't help, please file a <a href="https://github.com/gapato/velimonde/issues">bug report</a> on Github including OS and browser! Thanks!
