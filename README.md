## VÃ©limonde

### Overview

Rather stupid webapp showing location and availability of automated bike rental stations.
This works for cities which have some kind of partnership with JCDecaux for deployment.

### TODO

* Be very kind and try to make it behave OK on hand-held thingies
* Option to disable background to save bandwidth
* Find a better background (no need for freaking _buildings_ to be on there) and stop leeching OSM.org
* Etc.

### Demo

You can check [the demo](http://velimonde.oknaj.eu/) out.

Some say there's a [REST API](http://velimonde.oknaj.eu/api) you can use to access a city or station
directly.

### Licence

This work is license under the likable [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/).

The real-time data is available at [developer.jcdecaux.com](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/) under ODC-BY, CC-BY 2.0 license.
If you want to serve the data yourself (you can, so you should), you need to get _your very own_ API key and make the data available under
``/static/contracts.json`` for the list of areas available, and ``/data/<city_name>.json`` for the stations in each area.
Note that ``contracts.json`` has a different format than the one served by JCDecaux to speed up lookups.
